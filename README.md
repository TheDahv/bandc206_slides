# Beer && Code 1 Year Party Web Presentation

I'm working on a presentation for a talk I'll give at our 1-year party.

I'm also borrowing inspiration (and some code) from Google's awesome [HTML5](http://slides.html5rocks.com) 
[presentations](http://html5slides.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/template/index.html).

Specifically, I'm following their example for the CSS3 and JavaScript, but the
rest came from my brain-thoughts.

I should also mention, I'm building this using the [Cloud9 IDE](http://cloud9ide.com/) and it's actually 
really really cool. If you are looking at this because you have a GitHub account, you can log in and start using Cloud9. It comes with a node-capable workspace, so I'm able to run all this from the browser. Go check it out.

To run the thing, you need the following:

* [node](http://nodejs.org)

Then you need to type this into a terminal in the project folder:

    node app.js

The required modules are already included in the source (perhaps it's not the best practice, but it's just a slide show)
    
This works really well on a large monitor, and not as well on a small monitor. This is definitely designed to get projected on a wall.
If you have troubles...um, fork it and suggest me a more responsive design.

Also, if you are mad at me for hot-linking images, let me know and we can work something out.
    
Let me know what you think, and feel free to borrow!
