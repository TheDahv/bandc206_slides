# Beer && Code 1 Year Party Web Presentation

I'm working on a presentation for a talk I'll give at our 1-year party.

I'm also borrowing inspiration (and some code) from Google's awesome [HTML5](http://slides.html5rocks.com) 
[presentations](http://html5slides.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/template/index.html).

Specifically, I'm following their example for the CSS3 and JavaScript, but the
rest came from my brain-thoughts.

I should also mention, I'm building this using the Cloud9 IDE and it's actually 
really really cool. Go check it out.

To run the thing, you need the following:

* [node](http://nodejs.org)
* [npm](http://npmjs.org)

Then you need to type these things:

    npm install
    node app.js
    
Let me know what you think, and feel free to borrow!
